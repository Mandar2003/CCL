            <div class="desc">HEAD AND SHOULDER PATTERN</div>
            <div class="desc1">Head and shoulders is a chart pattern in which a large peak has a slightly smaller peak
                on either side of it. Traders look at head and shoulders patterns to predict a bullish-to-bearish
                reversal.
                Typically, the first and third peak will be smaller than the second, but they will all fall back to the
                same level of support, otherwise known as the ‘neckline’. Once the third peak has fallen back to the
                level of support, it is likely that it will breakout into a bearish downtrend.

            <div class="desc">DOUBLE TOP</div>
            <div class="desc1">A double top is another pattern that traders use to highlight trend reversals.
                Typically, an asset’s price will experience a peak, before retracing back to a level of support.
                It will then climb up once more before reversing back more permanently against the prevailing trend.

            <div class="desc">DOUBLE BOTTOM</div>
            <div class="desc1">A double bottom chart pattern indicates a period of selling, causing an asset’s price to
                drop
                below a level of support.
                It will then rise to a level of resistance, before dropping again. Finally, the trend will reverse and
                begin
                an upward motion as the market becomes more bullish.
                A double bottom is a bullish reversal pattern, because it signifies the end of a downtrend and a shift
                towards an uptrend.

            <div class="desc">ROUNDING BOTTOM</div>
            <div class="desc1">A rounding bottom chart pattern can signify a continuation or a reversal. For instance, 
                during an uptrend an asset’s price may fall back slightly before rising once more. 
                This would be a bullish continuation.
                An example of a bullish reversal rounding bottom – shown below – would be if an asset’s 
                price was in a downward trend and a rounding bottom formed before the trend reversed and entered a bullish uptrend.
                Traders will seek to capitalise on this pattern by buying halfway around the bottom,
                 at the low point, and capitalising on the continuation once it breaks above a level of resistance.

            <div class="desc">CUP AND HANDLE PATTERN</div>
            <div class="desc1">The cup and handle pattern is a bullish continuation pattern that is used to show a period of 
                bearish market sentiment before the overall trend finally continues in a bullish motion. The cup appears similar 
                to a rounding bottom chart pattern, and the handle is similar to a wedge pattern – which is explained in the next section.
                Following the rounding bottom, the price of an asset will likely enter a temporary retracement, which is known as
                 the handle because this retracement is confined to two parallel lines on the price graph. The asset will eventually 
                 reverse out of the handle and continue with the overall bullish trend.

            <div class="desc">WEDGES PATTERN</div>
            <div class="desc1">Wedges form as an asset’s price movements tighten between two sloping trend lines. 
                There are two types of wedge: rising and falling.
                A rising wedge is represented by a trend line caught between two upwardly slanted lines of support and resistance. 
                In this case the line of support is steeper than the resistance line. This pattern generally signals 
                that an asset’s price will eventually decline more permanently – which is demonstrated when it breaks through the support level.
