            <div class="desc">Volume</div>
            <div class="desc1">The indicator is a running total of up volume minus down volume.
                Up volume is how much volume there is on a day when the price rallied. Down volume is the
                volume on a day when the price falls. Each day volume is added or subtracted from the indicator
                based on whether the price went higher or lower.

                When OBV is rising, it shows that buyers are willing to step in and push the price higher. When OBV
                is falling, the selling volume is outpacing buying volume, which indicates lower prices. In this way,
                it acts like a trend confirmation tool. If price and OBV are rising, that helps indicate a continuation
                of the trend.

                Traders who use OBV also watch for divergence. This occurs when the indicator and price are going in
                different directions. If the price is rising but OBV is falling, that could indicate that the trend
                is not backed by strong buyers and could soon reverse.

            <div class="desc">Average Directional Index</div>
            <div class="desc1">The average directional index (ADX) is a trend indicator used to measure the strength and
                momentum of a trend. When the ADX is above 40, the trend is considered to have a lot of directional
                strength, either up or down, depending on the direction the price is moving.

                When the ADX indicator is below 20, the trend is considered to be weak or non-trending.

                The ADX is the main line on the indicator, usually colored black. There are two additional lines that
                can be optionally shown. These are DI+ and DI-. These lines are often colored red and green,
                respectively. All three lines work together to show the direction of the trend as well as the momentum
                of the trend.

                ADX above 20 and DI+ above DI-: That's an uptrend.
                ADX above 20 and DI- above DI+: That's a downtrend.
                ADX below 20 is a weak trend or ranging period, often associated with the DI- and DI+ rapidly
                crisscrossing each other.

            <div class="desc">MACD</div>
            <div class="desc1">The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator helps traders see the trend
                direction, as well as the momentum of that trend. It also provides a number of trade signals.

                When the MACD is above zero, the price is in an upward phase. If the MACD is below zero, it has entered
                a bearish period.

                The indicator is composed of two lines: the MACD line and a signal line, which moves slower. When MACD
                crosses below the signal line, it indicates that the price is falling. When the MACD line crosses above
                the signal line, the price is rising.

                Looking at which side of zero the indicator is on aids in determining which signals to follow. For
                example, if the indicator is above zero, watch for the MACD to cross above the signal line to buy. If
                the MACD is below zero, the MACD crossing below the signal line may provide the signal for a possible
                short trade.

            <div class="desc">Relative Strength Index</div>
            <div class="desc1">The relative strength index (RSI) has at least three major uses. The indicator moves
                between zero and 100, plotting recent price gains versus recent price losses. The RSI levels therefore
                help in gauging momentum and trend strength.

                The most basic use of an RSI is as an overbought and oversold indicator. When RSI moves above 70, the
                asset is considered overbought and could decline. When the RSI is below 30, the asset is oversold and
                could rally. However, making this assumption is dangerous; therefore, some traders wait for the
                indicator to rise above 70 and then drop below before selling, or drop below 30 and then rise back above
                before buying.

                Divergence is another use of the RSI. When the indicator is moving in a different direction than the
                price, it shows that the current price trend is weakening and could soon reverse.

                A third use for the RSI is support and resistance levels. During uptrends, a stock will often hold above
                the 30 level and frequently reach 70 or above. When a stock is in a downtrend, the RSI will typically
                hold below 70 and frequently reach 30 or below.
